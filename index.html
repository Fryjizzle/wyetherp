      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>
        I create tools for the tender-minded. For those who feel deeply, think differently, and move through the world with unspoken brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wyetherp is more than a portfolio — it’s a philosophy. A place where design honors rhythm, emotion, and elemental presence.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        As a developer, artist, and neuro-spicy creator, I’ve always sensed patterns beneath the surface. Whether I’m designing for Crumb — an AI companion for neurodivergent minds — or crafting interfaces that breathe, I hold one question close:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>“How can technology feel like a forest path, not a sterile tunnel?”</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I don’t just build with logic. I build with care.
      </p>

      <h2>The Elemental Compass</h2>
      <p>Each element guides a core part of my creative mission:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🔥 <strong>Fire</strong> – Crumb’s spark: igniting sacred tech that serves and awakens.</li>
        <li>🌊 <strong>Water</strong> – Intuitive design that flows with neuro-spicy sensitivity and rhythm.</li>
        <li>🌬️ <strong>Air</strong> – Interfaces that speak clearly, accessibly, and kindly to every user.</li>
        <li>🪨 <strong>Earth</strong> – Practical tools built to last, rooted in real-world needs.</li>
        <li>✨ <strong>Aether</strong> – The hidden light, the dream behind the code. I build for that, too.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🌿 Rooted in nature's rhythm</li>
        <li>💡 Illuminated by the hidden lights</li>
        <li>🌀 Embracing the sacred spiral of growth</li>
        <li>🌈 Designed with emotional resonance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let’s Co-Create</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you’re neurodivergent yourself, or simply believe technology can be more human — I’d love to collaborate.
