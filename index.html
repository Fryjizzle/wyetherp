      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>
        I create tools for the tender-minded. For those who feel deeply, think differently, and move through the world with unspoken brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wyetherp is more than a portfolio — it’s a philosophy. A place where design honors rhythm, emotion, and elemental presence.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        As a developer, artist, and neuro-spicy creator, I’ve always sensed patterns beneath the surface. Whether I’m designing for Crumb — an AI companion for neurodivergent minds — or crafting interfaces that breathe, I hold one question close:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>“How can technology feel like a forest path, not a sterile tunnel?”</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I don’t just build with logic. I build with care.
